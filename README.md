# Employee-Alert-Popup
#Main Function
The Employee Alert Popup is a program which displays specific reminders on a computer based on database records. The program initially runs a SQL query that joins multiple tables together. The code looks at the date for which the popup is to be displayed and then adds that date to a dictionary object. There is a timer that ticks every 0.9 seconds that is constantly looking to see if the dates in the dictionary object match the current time. When the date and time do match, a form is then displayed on the screen with a specific message which is determined by one of the database records. The user is prompted to select a current user and then press acknowledge. If left unacknowledged, the popup will stay on the screen based on another record in one of the tables. If it is acknowledged, the popup will turn green and stay on the screen for a short period of time. There is also another form that is always visible which displays the next time a popup (or if there is more than one, popups) will be displayed.
#Powershell 
There are two Windows Powershell scripts included with the installer. The one script, upon installation, creates a Windows task which stipulates that upon logon of the computer, the program will run, while continuing to check every five minutes that the application is still running; it will start it again if it is not. The other script, upon uninstallation, deletes the Windows task that was created upon installation.
